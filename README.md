## Project Description

### Domain

**Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC)**

AACorn is a Java-based visual AAC application designed primarily for autistic children around ages 5–12 with limited functional speech.

The goal is to help a child communicate simple everyday needs using pictograms.

**Example:**  
`I want` → `Water` → **"I want water."**

The first version focuses on functional communication rather than emotion detection, pain assessment, behaviour prediction, or other therapy-related features.

### Project Mascot

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/aacorn-mascot.png" width="541" alt="AACorn mascot">
</p>

AACorn's mascot is an original acorn-inspired character designed by Ruoshui Deng. It is used for project branding rather than as a functional AAC pictogram.

---

## User Stories

### Child

1. **As a child, I want to select pictograms so that I can communicate something I want.**

2. **As a child, I want quick access to Help, Stop, and Break so that I can communicate important needs easily.**

### Caregiver

3. **As a caregiver, I want to search for, add, and remove pictograms so that I can customize the child's communication board.**

4. **As a caregiver, I want to view previous messages so that I can see what the child has communicated.**

---

## Use Cases

### UC1 - Communicate a Request

**Actor:** Child

**Precondition:** The communication board contains at least one available pictogram.

**Trigger:** The child wants to communicate a request.

**Success Outcome:** A completed message is created and can be stored in communication history.

**Main Scenario:**

1. The child selects pictograms from the communication board.
2. The selected pictograms appear in the current message.
3. The child may add, repeat, remove, or clear selections.
4. The system constructs a readable message from the selected pictograms.
5. The completed message is sent.

**Extensions:**

- The same pictogram may be selected more than once.
- The child may remove a selected pictogram.
- An incomplete or cleared draft is not stored as a completed message.

---

### UC2 - Communicate a Core Message

**Actor:** Child

**Trigger:** The child selects **Help**, **Stop**, or **Break**.

**Success Outcome:** The selected core message is immediately available for communication.

**Main Scenario:**

1. The child selects a core message.
2. The system creates the corresponding communication message.
3. The completed message can be stored in communication history.

---

### UC3 - Customize the Communication Board

**Actor:** Caregiver

**Precondition:** The caregiver has entered caregiver mode.

**Trigger:** The caregiver chooses **Customize Board**.

**Success Outcome:** The child's available pictograms are updated.

**Main Scenario:**

1. The caregiver views the current communication board.
2. The caregiver may remove an existing pictogram.
3. The caregiver may select **Add Pictogram**.
4. The caregiver searches ARASAAC by keyword.
5. Matching pictograms are displayed.
6. The caregiver selects a pictogram to add to the board.
7. The updated board is saved.

**Extension:**

- If the API is unavailable or no matching pictogram is found, the system displays an appropriate message.

---

### UC4 - View Communication History

**Actor:** Caregiver

**Precondition:** At least one completed communication message has been saved.

**Trigger:** The caregiver chooses **History**.

**Success Outcome:** Previous communication messages are displayed in chronological order.

**Main Scenario:**

1. The caregiver opens communication history.
2. The system loads saved messages.
3. The messages are displayed with their timestamps.

---

## Minimal Viable Product (MVP)

Each team member will take the lead on one MVP use case.

| Team Member | MVP Use Case |
|---|---|
| TBD | UC1 - Communicate a Request |
| TBD | UC2 - Communicate a Core Message |
| TBD | UC3 - Customize the Communication Board |
| TBD | UC4 - View Communication History |

> MVP use-case ownership will be finalized before Phase 2 implementation.

## Entities

### `Pictogram`

Represents one selectable AAC symbol.

**Instance Variables**

```java
int id
String label
String imageLocation
```

**Relevant Methods**

```java
getId()
getLabel()
getImageLocation()
```

---

### `CommunicationDraft`

Represents the temporary message currently being constructed by the child.

**Instance Variables**

```java
String sentenceStarter
List<Pictogram> selectedPictograms
```

**Relevant Methods**

```java
addPictogram(...)
removeLastPictogram()
removePictogramAt(...)
repeatPictogramAt(...)
clear()
previewText()
buildMessage(...)
```

---

### `CommunicationMessage`

Represents a completed message sent by the child.

**Instance Variables**

```java
List<Pictogram> selectedPictograms
String text
LocalDateTime timestamp
```

**Relevant Methods**

```java
getSelectedPictograms()
getText()
getTimestamp()
```

A completed `CommunicationMessage` is immutable and is kept separate from the child's current `CommunicationDraft`.

---

### `CommunicationBoard`

Represents the vocabulary currently available to the child.
A caregiver can add or remove pictograms.

**Instance Variables**

```java
int capacity                  // default 20
List<Pictogram> pictograms
```

**Relevant Methods**

```java
addPictogram(...)
removePictogram(...)
contains(...)
isFull()
getPictograms()
```

**Business Rules**

- The same pictogram cannot appear twice on the board (the child can still select it more than once in a draft).
- The board holds at most 6 pictograms by default.
- Removing a pictogram that is not on the board is an error.
- Pictograms keep the order chosen by the caregiver.

---

### `ChildProfile`

Represents all saved data for the child using the app.
AACorn is designed for **one child per installation**.

**Instance Variables**

```java
CommunicationBoard board
List<CommunicationMessage> history
```

**Relevant Methods**

```java
getBoard()
addMessage(...)
getHistory()
hasHistory()
```

**Business Rules**

- History is kept in the order messages were sent (oldest first).
- History can only be added to through `addMessage`; it cannot be edited or reordered from outside.

### Entity Relationships

```
ChildProfile
 ├── CommunicationBoard ── contains many Pictograms
 └── history: many CommunicationMessages ── each contains the Pictograms the child selected

CommunicationDraft ── builds ──> CommunicationMessage
```

---

## API Usage

**API Name:** ARASAAC API

**Documentation:** [ARASAAC API documentation](ADD_OFFICIAL_API_LINK_HERE)

**How it is used in the program:**

- search for pictograms by keyword
- retrieve pictogram metadata
- retrieve pictogram images
- allow caregivers to add selected pictograms to the communication board

**Current Status:** API research and Java integration are in progress. API functionality has not yet been merged into `main`.

---

## Project Structure

The code follows Clean Architecture. Inner layers never depend on outer layers.

| Package | Contents |
|---|---|
| `entity` | Domain classes and business rules (`Pictogram`, `CommunicationBoard`, `ChildProfile`, …) |
| `use_case/<use_case>` | Interactors, input/output data, data access interfaces |
| `interface_adapter/<use_case>` | Controllers, presenters, view models |
| `data_access` | JSON storage and ARASAAC API calls |
| `view` | Java Swing screens |
| `app` | `Main`, where all layers are connected |

Use-case subpackages: `communicate_request` (UC1), `core_message` (UC2), `customize_board` (UC3), `view_history` (UC4).

---
## Persistence

AACorn stores all of the child's data in one local JSON file: `data/profile.json`.

```json
{
  "board": [
    { "id": 2248, "label": "water", "imageLocation": "https://.../2248.png" },
    { "id": 2462, "label": "apple", "imageLocation": "https://.../2462.png" }
  ],
  "history": [
    {
      "text": "I want water.",
      "timestamp": "2026-10-26T10:00:00",
      "pictograms": [
        { "id": 2248, "label": "water", "imageLocation": "https://.../2248.png" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Design decisions**

- `board` keeps the caregiver's order; `history` is oldest first.
- Each history message stores a **full copy** of its pictograms, not just their IDs. History is a record of what was said, so it must still display correctly after a pictogram is removed from the board or when the ARASAAC API is offline.
- Timestamps use ISO-8601 format so they can be read back with `LocalDateTime.parse()`.

**Data access interfaces**

Following Clean Architecture, each use case defines the data access it needs in its own `use_case` package. One class in `data_access` will implement all of them by reading and writing `profile.json`.

| Use case | Interface | Methods |
|---|---|---|
| UC1 Communicate a Request | `CommunicateRequestDataAccessInterface` | `getBoard()`, `saveMessage(...)` |
| UC2 Core Message | `CoreMessageDataAccessInterface` | `saveMessage(...)` |
| UC3 Customize Board | `CustomizeBoardDataAccessInterface` | `getBoard()`, `saveBoard(...)` |
| UC4 View History | `ViewHistoryDataAccessInterface` | `getHistory()` |

Development and testing use sample data rather than real clinical data.

## Design Diagrams

### UI Flow

AACorn has a child-facing communication interface and a separate caregiver mode.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/UI-draft.png" width="2791" alt="AACorn UI flow">
</p>

Caregiver mode is accessed from the child interface through a settings button and a 4-digit PIN screen.

The caregiver can then choose between:

- **History**
- **Customize Board**

### UML Class Diagram

#### Entities

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Pictogram {
        -int id
        -String label
        -String imageLocation
        +getId() int
        +getLabel() String
        +getImageLocation() String
    }
    class CommunicationBoard {
        +int DEFAULT_CAPACITY$
        -int capacity
        -List~Pictogram~ pictograms
        +addPictogram(Pictogram) void
        +removePictogram(Pictogram) void
        +contains(Pictogram) boolean
        +isFull() boolean
        +getPictograms() List~Pictogram~
    }
    class CommunicationDraft {
        -String sentenceStarter
        -List~Pictogram~ selectedPictograms
        +addPictogram(Pictogram) void
        +removeLastPictogram() Pictogram
        +removePictogramAt(int) Pictogram
        +repeatPictogramAt(int) void
        +clear() void
        +previewText() String
        +buildMessage(LocalDateTime) CommunicationMessage
    }
    class CommunicationMessage {
        -List~Pictogram~ selectedPictograms
        -String text
        -LocalDateTime timestamp
        +getSelectedPictograms() List~Pictogram~
        +getText() String
        +getTimestamp() LocalDateTime
    }
    class ChildProfile {
        -CommunicationBoard board
        -List~CommunicationMessage~ history
        +getBoard() CommunicationBoard
        +addMessage(CommunicationMessage) void
        +getHistory() List~CommunicationMessage~
        +hasHistory() boolean
    }
    ChildProfile "1" *-- "1" CommunicationBoard : board
    ChildProfile "1" *-- "0..*" CommunicationMessage : history
    CommunicationBoard "1" o-- "0..6" Pictogram : pictograms
    CommunicationMessage "1" o-- "1..*" Pictogram : selectedPictograms
    CommunicationDraft "1" o-- "0..*" Pictogram : selectedPictograms
    CommunicationDraft ..> CommunicationMessage : builds
```

- A `ChildProfile` owns one `CommunicationBoard` and the message history (composition).
- Boards, drafts and messages refer to `Pictogram`s, which can appear in several places (aggregation).
- A `CommunicationDraft` builds an immutable `CommunicationMessage`.

#### Data Access

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class CommunicateRequestDataAccessInterface {
        <<interface>>
        +getBoard() CommunicationBoard
        +saveMessage(CommunicationMessage) void
    }
    class CoreMessageDataAccessInterface {
        <<interface>>
        +saveMessage(CommunicationMessage) void
    }
    class CustomizeBoardDataAccessInterface {
        <<interface>>
        +getBoard() CommunicationBoard
        +saveBoard(CommunicationBoard) void
    }
    class ViewHistoryDataAccessInterface {
        <<interface>>
        +getHistory() List~CommunicationMessage~
    }
    class PictogramSearchDataAccessInterface {
        <<interface>>
        +searchPictograms(String) List~Pictogram~
    }
    class FileProfileDataAccessObject {
        <<planned>>
        -String filePath
        -ChildProfile profile
    }
    class ArasaacDataAccessObject {
        <<planned>>
    }
    class ChildProfile
    FileProfileDataAccessObject ..|> CommunicateRequestDataAccessInterface
    FileProfileDataAccessObject ..|> CoreMessageDataAccessInterface
    FileProfileDataAccessObject ..|> CustomizeBoardDataAccessInterface
    FileProfileDataAccessObject ..|> ViewHistoryDataAccessInterface
    ArasaacDataAccessObject ..|> PictogramSearchDataAccessInterface
    FileProfileDataAccessObject --> ChildProfile : loads and saves
```

- Each use case defines only the data access it needs (Interface Segregation).
- Interfaces live in `use_case`; implementations live in `data_access` (Dependency Inversion).
- Classes marked `<<planned>>` will be implemented in Phase 2.
